## Hi 👋

### Teeko Project
- https://github.com/Ardou0/Teeko-IA41
- In this project, I was able to learn about the Python interface with tkinter and how the game plays out on the page.
- Learn the minmax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning


### Trio Project
- https://github.com/Ardou0/Java-Trio-AP4B
- In this project, I created the entire interface with JavaFX and the controller part linking the pages.
- I was also able to link the model with the view in a controller package to follow the MVC model.
